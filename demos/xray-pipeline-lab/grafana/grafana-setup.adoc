= Setup the Grafana environment

We will now implenent the Grafana dashboards we'll use to monitor our pipeline.

The Grafana operator has already been installed for you in your namespace. We'll first create some resources that we need.

== Data Sources

=== MySQL Datasource
The MySQL helper database contains informations (name, timestamps) on the uploaded, processed, and anomymized images. +
We will display these informations on the dashboard.

.Create the MySQL Datasource
[bash]
----
oc apply -f grafana-mysql-datasource.yaml
----

=== Prometheus Datasource
The OpenShit Prometheus database contains information on the deployments, pods, CPU,... +
We will display these informations on the dashboard.

.Create the Prometheus Datasource
[bash]
----
oc apply -f grafana-prometheus-datasource.yaml
----

== Dashboards
There are two different dashboards used in this lab. A general one displaying the pipeline, and one only showing the images at a greater scale.

As those dashboards are defined through a JSON definition that cannot be easily customized with variables, we will use OpenShift Templates, process them with the right parameters, and apply them.

=== Main dashboard
The parameters you'll need to replace in these commands are:

* `image_server_url`: the route to the image server deployment. It's an external route that your browser will directly connect to to retrieve and display the images.
* `bucket_base_name`: the bucket base name you are using for this lab. It's used to form the location of the image to retrieve.
* `namespace`: the name of you project. It's used to query the right metrics from Prometheus (Pods, CPU,...)

.Create the main dashboard by processing the template
[bash]
----
oc process -f grafana-xraylab-dashboard-template.yaml -p image_server_url=<replace_me> -p bucket_base_name=<replace_me> -p namespace=<replace_me> | oc apply -f -
----

Example: +
`oc process -f grafana-xraylab-dashboard-template.yaml -p image_server_url=https://image-server-my-namespace.apps.cluster-2f55.2f55.example.opentlc.com -p bucket_base_name=xray-images -p namespace=xray-demo | oc apply -f -`

=== Images dashboard
The parameters you'll need to replace in these commands are:

* `image_server_url`: the route to the image server deployment. It's an external route that your browser will directly connect to to retrieve and display the images.
* `bucket_base_name`: the bucket base name you are using for this lab. It's used to form the location of the image to retrieve.

.Create the images dashboard by processing the template
[bash]
----
oc process -f grafana-xraylab-images-dashboard-template.yaml -p image_server_url=<replace_me> -p bucket_base_name=<replace_me> | oc apply -f -
----

Example: +
 `oc process -f grafana-xraylab-images-dashboard-template.yaml -p image_server_url=https://image-server-xray-demo.apps.perf3.ocs.lab.eng.blr.redhat.com -p bucket_base_name=xray-images | oc apply -f -`
